What is Machine Learning?
- Machine learning is a method od fata analysis that automates analytical model building

- Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find 
hidden insights without being explicityly programmed where to look

Types of alogs
1. Supervised learning
  Labeled data trying to predict a label based off of known features

2. Unsupervised learning
  Unlabeled data that you are trying to group together into similar data points based off of features

3. Reinforcement learning
  Algorithm learns to perform an action from experience
